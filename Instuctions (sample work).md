## Requirements to Get ChatGPT to Work with Siri

1. **Siri ChatGPT Shortcut**
   - The integration of ChatGPT into Siri works through a handy shortcut named Siri Pro. Download the [Siri Pro shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e3b3a71269364bbd9cadef9c7fefbba0) and keep it ready.

2. **ChatGPT API Key**
   - To use ChatGPT’s services with Siri, obtain the API key from your OpenAI account. Visit the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create a new secret key. Copy the generated API key.
